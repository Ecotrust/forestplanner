      <h1>About the Forest Planner</h1>
      <p>
        Ecotrust has created the Forest Planner to give forest management scenario planning capacity to all Oregon and Washington land managers. Users will be able to <em>visualize alternative management scenarios</em> on your lands and receive immediate feedback on <em>how decisions might pay off</em> in terms of timber harvests and financial returns, as well as <em>public benefits</em> like carbon storage and ecosystem services.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h3>With the Forest Planner, you will be able to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find and map your property with helpful map layers such as tax lots.</li>
        <li>Map out the forest stands and management units on your property with helpful map layers such as riparian buffers and steep slopes.</li>
        <li>Define and map out the type of trees found in each of your stands (species, diameter class, trees per acre).</li>
        <li>Choose from a spectrum of harvest practices and apply them to the management units you want.</li>
        <li>Create customized management scenarios that represent the combination of management practices you assigned across your property.</li>
        <li>Quickly compare different management scenarios with graphs and maps; see outputs like timber yields and stocking, carbon storage, and more.</li>
        <li>Securely and confidently store and manage data about your property and management scenarios you have run.</li>
	  </ul>
