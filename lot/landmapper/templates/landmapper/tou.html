    </p>
    <p>
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH ECOTRUST AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ECOTRUST.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and Ecotrust agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Services, except that you and Ecotrust are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Ecotrust agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Ecotrust shall be sent to Ecotrust, 1140 SE 7th Avenue, Suite 150, Portland, Oregon 97214. You and Ecotrust further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Multnomah County, Oregon; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association; and that the state or federal courts in Multnomah County, Oregon have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by these Terms, this agreement, and the laws of the State of Oregon and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Ecotrust will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

    <p>
        15. Severability; No Waiver
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. A delay in our enforcement of these Terms shall not constitute a modification of these Terms or the waiver of any enforcement or other rights hereunder.
