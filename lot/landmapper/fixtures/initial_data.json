    "content": "<p>The data collected can tell you so many interesting things about your forest! The&nbsp;<strong>Forest Type</strong>&nbsp;is defined by the dominant species on your property. Forest types are influenced by climate, soil, temperature, past management activities, aspect, resource availability (such as water or nutrients), and slope. <strong>Class size</strong> helps illustrate the growing conditions and age of the trees, and the size class groupings differentiate the diameters at breast height of all the trees measured.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>quadratic mean diameter (QMD)</strong>, essentially the standard deviation from the mean, is the basal area-weighted average diameter of the trees in the stand.&nbsp;<strong>Stocking&nbsp;</strong>describes how dense the trees are growing together and is calculated by basal area per acre or trees per acre.&nbsp;<strong>Basal area (BA)</strong>&nbsp;is the cross-sectional area of a tree in square feet, at 4.5 feet above ground level (also known as Breast Height). To understand the stand&#39;s density, sum all the basal areas of the trees in a stand together (square feet per acre).&nbsp;<strong>Trees per acre (TPA)&nbsp;</strong>calculates the number of trees per acre, which tells the forester how many trees in an area but it does not inform the forester how big those trees are. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to know both TPA and BA.&nbsp;<strong>Forest structure</strong>&nbsp;describes the vertical and horizontal distribution of layers in the forest. One important indicator is&nbsp;<strong>Canopy Cover</strong>, which can be defined as sparse (0-10%), open (10-40%), moderate (40-70%), or closed (70-100%).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[FUN FACT! QMD = square root ((basal area / tree per acre) / 0.005454)). 0.005454 is also known as the Forester&#39;s Constant, which is the conversion of DBH from inches to feet divided by 2 (to convert from a diameter to a&nbsp;radius) * pi.]&nbsp;</p>"
